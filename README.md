# research-kernel
A personal project for researching and developing a kernel.

## Goals
Learning how operating systems work and developing a kernel from scratch have always been what I have strived for. While I find joy in developing software in most areas of the software industry, this particular niche appears to be the one for me, as a hobby (at least for now).
As a side goal to developing this kernel, I am planning on taking various notes, and authoring a document covering everything that I learn from this project.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Compile and run a bare-bones kernel in C
- [ ] Migrate the kernel source to C++ (will probablly have to be pure C++ without any libraries)
- [ ] (Optional) Migrate boot.s to NASM
- [ ] Evaluate if libc++, libunwind, and friends can be integrated into the kernel

Rest of the roadmap TBD...
